2016-06-27: Guide to sync with upstream:

# ONLY DO IT AT THE FIRST TIME
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android.git

# Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches,
# such as upstream/master:
# git fetch upstream
git fetch upstream/master

# Make sure that you're on your master branch:
git checkout master

# Rewrite your master branch so that any commits of yours that
# aren't already in upstream/master are replayed on top of that
# other branch:
# ONLY DO IT AT THE FIRST TIME
git rebase upstream/master

# Otherwise, merge with the upstream
git merge upstream/master

# ONLY DO IT AT THE FIRST TIME
git push -f origin master

# Otherwise, just push
git push origin master
